Things in dart to learn
1. Dart uses classes but these classes are not like one we use in c++ here default class is public.
   For ex:-
   class Animal{
    int? age;
    String? name;
   }
   
2. Both age and name are public and the ? after type of value is null safety.

3. If a function has same name as the name of the class then it is a default constructor and the one with parameters is parameterized constructor.

4. To make a variable or function private just simply add "_" before the name of the variable or function
   For ex:-
   class Food{
    int? _calories;
    String? _name;
   }
